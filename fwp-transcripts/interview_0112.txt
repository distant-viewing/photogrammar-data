E. J. AND MATTIE MARSHALL, OVERSEER OF TENANTS
E. J. and Mattie Marshall live in a two-story house at the corner of Alabama and Maryland streets in Cork, a suburb of Plant City, Florida. A granddaughter, Eddie Mercedes Marshall lives with them. Their six-room home is constructed of unpainted weatherboard and has a shingle roof, mossy with age. Outside, next to a dilapidated car shed where farm implements are stored, is a shack which houses E.J's mule, Beck.
At one end of the front porch is a pile of out wood covered with a granary sack, a bushel basket, a sack of corn, and a cloth bag that hangs on the wall by the deer. At the ether end is an old table with a water bucket and a few pots and pans on it. Buckets of flowers are ranged against the wall. On a side porch are four wash tubs which serve the alternate purpose of wash tub and bath tub.
The lawn needs trimming, and the yard is full of overgrown shrubbery. Toward the rear of the lot, I see tow large cane bushes which are taller than the houses; these supply the Marshall's and their neighbors with fishing poles.
Mattie and E. J. are both on the porch when I come up. E. J. is checking his books. He is an overseer who leases for the Swift Company, to tenant farmers and does some farming for himself. He wears a tan straw hat with holes in it to keep his head cool. His shirt is dark gray and his trousers blue, bright yellow suspenders hold up the latter. Dangling from a trouser pocket to his watch pocket is a ponderous gold chain. His shoes are heavy brogans.
He politely invites me to come up on the porch, where he introduces me to his wife Mattie. Her complexion is much lighter than his and she has straight black hair. She greets me pleasantly and keeps looking at me ever the tope of her glasses which she wears far down on her nose. She has a clean white apron over her red and white dotted gingham, and bedroom slippers on her feet: "They's far comfort," she says apologetically.
I no sooner seat myself when two white men drive up in a new Ford. E. J. greets than heartily and excuses himself saying, "Thet oldest man has charge of the Swift company's biszess. He's come far all the money what I' se collected on the leases. "I controls 150 acres here. These is leased to 21 tenants. The 'mount of lan let out to sach tenant, ranges from I to 20 a acres, all accordin to the number of acres he kin farm. Now and agin one of them tries his bestus to beat us outtem some money by runnin away at tha end of the season. We charges then aroun $15 a year far one acre."
While E. J. goes down to talk with the men, Mattie shows me her home and I ask her where she comes from, "I was borned in Tamper, Florida most 62 year age. My folks was Josh and 'Lizabeth Belton. I had six sisters and six brudders, eight of them is still alivin. They's all in South caraliney, ceptin one sis what lives in Taxper.
"I was do fifth chile in the fambly. As far school, well, I want plum through da ninth grade. I has one chile, Josie Lee Johnson. Her man open rates a bisness on Laura Street."
While we chat we go through the house. The clean kitchen, with its linoleum covered floor comes first. There is a large cook stove, two small tables with cizeleth covers, and an old clothes closest where the dishes are kept. Next to the kitchen was a pantry room where odds and ends are stored.
In the good-sized middle room, which is sometimes used as a dining room, there is a large tabele near the steps leading to the second floor, a chima closet a silent clock. An old-fashioned clothes tree is laden with hates, cents and other artieles of wearing apparel. The walls of the room are covered with pictures, and a framed print of the Ten Commandments. The front room is clean and well furnished.
By this time E. J. is almost through, so Mattie and I sit down to wait. She has already told me that the five-acre tract across the road from them is owned by a Mack Wadsworth, a Megre who also has a business on Laura Street.
I watch the Negroes picking strawberries in the Wadswerth field across the read. They are talking and laughing. One is heard complaining: "Nothin--aint doin nothing" Another adds: "Me siree, ain't doin a God's thing." A foreman walks up and down the rows, his tray in hand, picking up the baskets of berries as quickly as they are filled. At the far side of the field there is a large building constructed of galvanized shooting, where the berries are being graded and packed.
E. J. returns to the porch, settles himself in a cane bottom chair and when I tell him what I want, comments, "This will there carry me way back yonder."
"I was berned in Edgefield, South Careliney, November 16, 1869. My ma and pa was Edward and Frances Marshall, they's daid now. They was slaves. Their master, his name was 'Crafts," and his was considered aristocrat folks. They was well knowed in South Caroliney.
"My pa brought $30,000 from Newberry to Aiken, South Caroliney for them one time. It was to pay fer a large plantation what the Crafts bouthten.
Now, you see, that's whar I gits my tradin abilities, it's from my pa.
"I was married to my first wife, Nellie I. Jiles, a long time age, she has been daid most 40 year now. She's the man to my two childrens. Raymond, my son, he has been in the pestal service in New York City fer 14 year Then my gal Bessie Lydia Brown lives with her husband. He's an undertaker down to Live Oak, Florida. They has two fine childrens.
"None of my younguns has ever give me trouble. The boy looks jest like me tool It's nice when you got childrens what grows up to well.
"I married Mattie, my second wife in Tamper, and brung her here nigh onte 38 year ago."
At this Mattie blurts out saroastically: "And thet is shore one long time to live in one place, believe-you-me!"
Ignoring her, E. J. continues: "I come to Alachua, Florida, from South Carelimey, and worked for the Western Union Telegraph Company. They larn me the trade as electrician. I was young then. I also had the distinction of bein promoted in less time than any man on the job. In three month I come from apprentice to line repairman. At that there time, we was stationed at Walde, Florida. Later I come to Tamper, to do electric work. I lived in Hillsbereugh County around 43 Year, right between Tamper and Plant City. I will be alivin here 38 year this comin January.
"I put the first electric light system here in Plant City. I larn to telegraph, too. Omeet I got up a conversation with my bose-man, Mr. George E. Harris, over to Jacksonville, ever the telegraph.
"This was shore some place when I first come here. On Laura Street at times we could wade in water what was knee high to waist deep fer about two blocks. This was shore low country then. You could go afishin and row boats in many a spot around here. Yes sir! You shore could. All out around here was jest dense woods. Oh! What a wonnerful rev-e-lay-tion. My goodness alive! A wonnerful improvement. Why this here place warn't no more than a wilderness.
"I was the first man what had a deed to a home in Lincoln Park, for that was it's name when I first come here. The track of lan you see right in front of you eyes now is name forme. It's call 'Marshall Heights."
"When I first come to Plant City there was very few colored folks here. Now the Negroes is jest about half. There is heaps more livin outside the city limits. I moved into this here house in 1910.
"The strawberry business ain't no small business. The cost of a nursery is from $20 to $25 an acre. I got eight acres under cultivation now. See that nice tractor over yonder in the fields That's mine. The colored mans runnin it is a fine Christian hearted feller, and he's reliable too.
"Some of the tenants makes money here, and some don't. We lets them lives their own lives. They raise other things besides strawberries, too. Some practionlly feeds theirselves ofen the lan. The $15 what they has to pay for the use of the lan is too much, but that's the bost' price, so what kin I do about it?
"Jest one thing that worries me about this farmin, and thet's the differences in prices for our goods. They us colored farmers one price for our feed, when the market is callin for another. I'm thinkin of mergin with a big grower from up Norfelk, Virginey, way. Thet's the place where they builds ships, ain't it? We kin raise stuff here and sell it at a greater profit. If you don't sell through the cooperative, and attempt to ship independent, the wise birds here wires ahead of your shipment, then when the shipment reaches its destination, they dumps yors. Thet is, we doan git no price for it. Thet's what us poor fellers is up again.
"I doan claim to have no education. I has made good contacts by readin and seekin good man and woman so fer. I only had four years of schoolin. That ain't much is it? Right now I takes four newspapers and some agricultural magazines. I been takin the Tamper Tribune for nearly 40 year."
Mattie says, "I kin remember when the Tamper Tribune started nearly in an ole house on Franklin Street. We also reads the Pittsburg courier."
E. J. resumes "I'se been on the trustee board, but the colored members wrangle so, 'till the white folks cuts them out. Now the board consults me. They takes my word whenever any matters comes up. Sometimes they calls me on the phone, and thet is all there is to it. I'se responsible fer thet new school building what they got over yonder. One day I thought that then colored boys and gals was needin a new play groun, and was I stun when I finds out they done went and fix it up. Honest, Doc, I jest couldn't go on and do things unless I knowed I was livin right."
E. J's stepdaughter rides up in a green Chevrolet car, E. J. says: "That's my car, and it's a fast steepper too. I hardly ever drives it. Though, I jest leaves it fer the childrens to enjoy themselves. Jest give me my old friend Book: we can make goed time up and down the rows. Thet's fast enough for me. You gets something out of thet. Take thet thing out there, it takes most everthing you our rake and sorape to keep it up. This worle is movin too fast fer me. Look at my house. It needs repairin right now and a paintin. The money I waste on thet car would do it, too. It's time folks was usin some judgment, but everbody wants to keep up with the style. And you ain't in style these days onless you has a bonze casket when you die. That's plum nonsense.
"No, I doan keep up with no politics. I ain't voted atall in the last few years. I quit foolin with it, I got disgusted I always voted Republican when I done my votn. But if I do it agin I'se gonna vote Democrat. That lily white mess disgusted me with the Republicans. I'se also would vote for the mans who in doin the peoples the moistest good. What we want is a man who will do what he says, and fer the good of all, an not jest the party.
"Since I'se been afarmin I'se lost flesh, but it's done me good and builded me up in health. My folks health has been party good as a whole. Nethin beats outdoor work. Some tells me to exercise like the boys what plays baseball and other games, but thet's plum fools advise. I taked mine in the garden with ole Beck, cause you kin git something out of thet.
"I think in another year I might go to raisin livestook. I think I kin make a go at it. Yeh, and there's good money in it, too, in fact I was oncet a cattleman. Thet's a life fer a family--freah eggs and butter. Too, I useter have a horse to ride, so'ens I could up them cattle. Thet's fine, I shore must like cattle the way I keep talkin about them.
"Oncet I had money and was fixed purty good in this town. Since the depression comed things has went haywire. I give up real business about eight year ago.
"I tried to be a trader all my life, but it's kinds difficult like to figger my income. I useter own lots of property, I sold thet. Like taxes has been durin the last several year, I hadda git rid of it. But I realize a purty fair livin from my tenants, you know my share after I settles with the boss-man. Countin everthin, though, I reckons I makes around $1,500 a year. Thet ain't all gravey neither.
"To make money or do anything else, it pays to git yourself on the Lord's side. I tries to keep on his side. I'se a member of the Allen chapel AME Church. Our paster is the Rev. Cooper. I belongs to the church from away back yonder. Spent me lifetime comin right up in it. I'se contributed to churches all my life. No, I don't goes to church as often as I shold now. When you gits older you sees so much you slows down a little. You'll git thet way some day. I kin see yor full of pep now jest from the many things you done ask me. But I sees a little different.
"Besides, the spirit existin with the ministers tends to lead to the Caser bizeness. The ranks and files an't regarded, onless you pay as you go. You is a good man ifen you has money, but doan go to church without it, onless you doan wants be made shame. I kin go an lay down a dollar and they calls my name so loud you in hear it plum around the block. But thet nickel-man you hardly knows he dropped in airy thing. He hardly gits a thank you. Thet's what I means when I talks about thet caeser bizness.
"You bet I like good things to eat: We has what we wants around here. I gets most of my food outten the soil, but what's better? I leves good old corn bread, an believe me I shore got someone who know how to cock it, too. Man that's half yor life!"
Mattie pesrs over her glasses and grins broadly.
"I also likes corn, peas, greens, beefstew, taters, rice, chicken, and eggs. We has a fine flock of White Rock chickens and I'se tryin to git a new strain of them from Knoxville, Tennessee. I has some hens now what weighs from five to seven pound. I also furnishes the teacher of the Home Ecnomics Class at our school with chickens. Sometime the class come over here and makes a study of them. Then I goes out and gives then younguns a talkin to. I'se beon able to bring out many fine pints that the teacher ain't knowed. You see you gotter put practical applications with theory. You know, thet's like the rabbit what was throwed in the briar patch, He looked up and jest grinned fer thet's what he belonged to be."
As her Grandpa Marshall finishes his narration, Eddie Merecedes, aged 17, dressed in overalls, come in from picking strawberries in the Wadsworth field across the road. She bounds past us into kitchen and rattles the kettles on the kitchen stove as she samples the cocking food. This makes her grandmother laugh.
When she comes out again, she gives me a friendly greeting and tells me that as soon as the berry season is over she is going to return to her studies at school. She sells tickets at the local colored theater in the evenings.
Her next gesture is an invitation to visit the Wadsworth packing house across the field from where she works. I accept the invitation, adding that I've never been in a strawberry packing house. The Packing house proves to be the galvanized building I had seen across the field from the Marshall porch.
When we enter the barn-like structure I notice the number of women employed. They are busy grading and packing the berries as they are brought from the field.
In the middle of the room is a long table with wire stretched over it. Clean granary sacks are spread over the wire. After the berries are washed in a tub of water they are dipped up in perforated tin vessels and dumped on the granary sacks. Excess water is absorbed by the sacks and drips through to the sand covered floor.
The average strawberry box contains about 75 berries, all according to variations in the size of the berry itself. When a crate is packed it holds 36 pints.
The pickers use quart boxes when picking berries. They earn three cents for every box. Some told me that they can pick from 25 to 80 boxes per day. A picker averages from $7.00 to $9.00 a week. As each box is finished the field foreman gives them a stub of paper with a number on it. These papers are counted when the picker is paid. A carrier transports the boxes from the field to the packing house in a long crate that holds 12 quarts.
Like Eddie, most of the young girls wear overalls while working in the fields. She says: "We gits eight cents or more at the market fer our berries, and a crate brings around three dollar now. They begins settin out the berry plants in September, and the pickin starts long about December.
"Wet weather and birds is the biggest trouble we has." Outside I notice a small boy and ani an old man walking diligently around the field on opposite sides. The man carries a high powered rifle and the boy an air rifle. Eddie explains that it is their job to keep the birds away from the field. As we walk down the steps I notice four dead robins lying there, and hear a woman say that she inteads taking them to eat.
As Eddie and I walk back to E. J's across the open field, I recall some information in my possession concerning the settlement of Cork.
At one time State Highway bordered the settlement. The town bore the Indian name of Ichnepuckanassa Echebucassa for short. In the Seminole language this meant "Indian Pipe." About fifty years age the post office authorities had difficulty spelling these names and recommended that the office be moved to Sweat's Millpond. This was accomplished and the town renamed Cork. They later moved the settlement to Plant City when the railroad came to that section. Today it is a suburb of Plant City, a flourishing agricultural center, noted for its strawberries. Records show shipments of 20,000,000 pints each season.
With a population of 8,000 persons, half are Negroes. The latter play a conspicuous part in tilling and working the vast tracts of land under cultivation. This includes truck farming and citrus growing.
During the berry seasons, which lasts from December through April, the town is a busy place. The schools are closed so that the children may help in the fields. Pickers range in age from 6 to 65 and sometimes older. Trucks loaded with human cargo are continually going to and from the fields, other trucks are engaged in transporting the berries to market.
The market, constructed by WPA, is another interesting site. A large place built in downtown Cork, it is where refrigerated trucks wait in line to take their consignments north.
When we arrive at E. J's., he is sitting on the porch bitting on the stem of his pipe.
"Well, what do you think of it?
I tell him that I like it and that it is all very interesting.
"Now, you see," he says, "this is all I do, when I ain't workin in my own garden spot. I kin see for miles around yere by jest sittin right here on my front porch. I kin see my men aworkin, an keep tab on everthing they's doi. When I walks around and checks the crops, them's days when I works. When I rest I'm doin this or I'se readin all them papers you see on the table yonder. They keeps me company. Mattie, she reads a lot too."
E. J. stops then and looks at his watch: "Lawsy me! It's three fifteen, I gotta be gittin in me garden, I got some corn to plant. How bout you comin along fer a time ifen you ain't got no more to do." He picked up the bag of corn on the porch and walked down the steps, I followed him He Went to the car shed where he got a hoe, then we both walked toward the garden in the rear of the house.
"This yere is a piece of lan I gardens when I doan feel like goin to the fields," he told me. "I makes lots of stuff on this piece of lan, it's rich. I gotta get some more corn to feed my mule Beck too.
"Sometimes I ketch ole Becky and shows them fool boys around yere how to plow. I was trained to plow when I was a boy about 16. My pa had around 60 acres on his last place. And you think we didn't larn how to plow! I can show any of them how it's done. I am one of God's men, and when yor a man who God has laid his hands on, beware!
"It's plum hard fer a man to make airy profit ofen a farm now. This yere war what's comin might make things a little better. You know! If thet war comes we won't be ready fer them furriners, cause we wasn't prepared for them last time it come. But they jest keep on letting them people fool them with their promises. They talks peace and at the same time gits theirselves ready to fout. But we'uns is sech good hearted folks, we jest takes it all in.
"Of course I believes in foutin, but the way to do it, is to bare yor knuckles and hit them square like they done in olden time. Back in then days it was ever man fer hisself an fout, or else..."
As E.J. talks he walks up and down his graden digging and dropping a grain of corn every two feet. He has tied a small white bag of corn to his belt straps, and is using this for seed.
"This yere is Yeller Cuban Flint Corn," he says "sometimes they calls Weevil Resistance Corn. The reason fer this is, it doan attract them weevils like the other corn do. This yere kind grows some seven foot tall.
E. J. falls silent after this last bit of information, and he walks along the rows, making a hole with his hoe, then dropping a grain of corn, making a hole and---
His next remark is one of meaning:--
"You know! You fine lots of hard workers around you if they happens to live next to a man what's thifty. If it warn't fer a thrifty feller among them's what lazy they'd all be lazy too, but as it is, they gits thrifty as the result. Now you take thet there mule of mine, yes sir! She gits me up at dawn ever time, as shore as you is borned. How she do's it is, she jest bray until I gits out to tend her, that's all. So then I'se thrifty cause then I up early, and thet makes other folks thrifty around me.
"Oncet I had a colt what brayed in the middle of the night. She'd bray until I called our to her, then she'd her mouth. You know, she brayed jest likes a person wantin me to call to her, then when I did she knowed my voice, so she shushed. It's something the way they gits to recognize yor voice, but hey do, jest like folks what talks over the telephone a lot. I useter talk over the telephone when I was livin in Teamper, it was when I was line fixin. I'd call in, and the operator would say, 'is that you Marshall?' and I'd tell her yes, but she always knowed my voice. Well that's the same way animals is.
"Another thing I always kept in my craw, was this. When I seed a feller worryin hisself plum to death, I jest think, I betcher ifen he would git hisself a lot of hard work to do, he wouldn't have no time to be seach a fool.
"Man! We's Livin in a great ole worle, it's jest like this game down yerer what we calls the bolita, always a gamble. Folks fusses a lot about us'uns playing it, but it ain't so bad. I would rather play that, then be walkin along the street and see someone drop a ten dollar bill, then I comes along and pick it up and not give it back to him. The Bolita is like bread cast upon the water, it do come back sometime or other.
"All in all though, this yere little town what I live in is purty good, in fact it's a exception. The niggers is all treated better than in the average town of the South. Boy I'm happy to tell you thet toe. Anyways a good nigger is a better class nigger, and I always feels he should be put in a class to hisself. A cracker man oncet tole me he didn't believe all niggers was alike anyways. But give a nigger a chncet, let him fix hisself up to appear better then the ones around him, and the better class of white folks appreciates us.
"One white man tole me one time, right before a bunch of niggers I was young then and it shore made me feel good. 'You never see Marshall without no necktie on. Now I can't do that, cause I spiles too many.' Well even thet showed thet I was something anyway.
"I has lets of confidence in what a lot of white men's tell me. You take this here Swift man what you seen me doin bizness with awhile ago. He's one of them rawbone cracker man, and they's fine. You've really got something when you got one of them on yor side, fer if there's any fouttin to be did, you dean hafter to do it, they does it fer you.
"He is talkin about promotin me now. But you know some time a promotion.
In an otherwise identical version, everything after line six on page 1090 was deleted.
Cause aspiration, and gives you a feelin thet a little less job gives more satisfaction without so much responsibility."
When I leave him to return to Plant City, he calls after me, When you comes down agin, be shore and come around to see me. And you is always welcome to whatever I got, exceptin my money, and a poor man ain't got no money from which he can depart."
As I drive through the other part of the colored section, I notice strawberries planted on every available spot. A few collard greens and other vegetables grow here and there. Everywhere the streets are here, everyone has gone to the fields.
Aside from one thickly settled area the community is scattered. Farms are owned by the Negroes, or leased from overseers. Negro labor is predominate.
I see a few of the old and dilapidated tenant houses E. J. has in his charge. There is no electricity in any of them and water is handpumped.
One tenant says: "We is able to make a livin on our five acre tract, and we's treated purty fair." I see one woman pushing a hand plow, opening rows for seed.
There is little profit in this type of farming, although they manage to live and make up the slack by obtaining odd jobs during the off seasons.
