Mrs. Katherine (Wilson) Fitzgerald, sister of J. Y. Wilson, was born and raised in Duval County, and is not families with Nassau County or Fernandina history.
She says: "My grand-mother and my mother were natives of Duval County. My father, George Simpson Wilson, came from the north of Ireland in 1855 and was married in Jacksonville to my mother, Catherine Anne Maria Maxey, of Pablo Beach. My grand-father Maxey had a grant of land at Pablo from the Spanish Government, recorded in the land office at St. Augustine, and later certified by the English Government.
My father, George S. Wilson and my uncle, James Young Wilson, for whom my brother is named, had a grocery store on East/Bay-st., near Main-st. My father was a soldier during the Confederacy and returned to his business in Jacksonville afterwards.
