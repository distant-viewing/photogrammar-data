Nick Poulas, Anglicized name of Nicholas Katsikopoulas, was born in Athens, Greece, March 15, 1895. His father was an employee, of a gas factory and was able to only give Nick a grammar school education. When Nick finished this at the age of fifteen he started to work as a cook on a steamship, and for years he continued this work, traveling to most of the important seaports in the world. When the World War started he volunteered for service in the Greek Navy and there remained until the war ended.
He then went back to his work as cook on one of the Greek vessels, and on one of the trips he came to New York.
Nick had brothers in New York and was so delighted with everything he saw and heard of America that he decided to leave the ship. He secured, almost immediately, a job as a cook in a Brooklyn restaurant.
At that time he could only speak a few words of English, so he went to night school for three months and learned enough English so that he felt at home. He kept that job there for two years then he secured another job which he held for eleven years.
In 1932 one of Nick's cousins invited him to come to Wilmington and accept a job as cook in his cafe at much higher wages. He came and worked for his cousin about a year, then he took over the management of the Boston Cafe which he has operated since with the aid of a partner, John Paris. They live together in quarters located over the cafe. They also employ three extra people, a Greek and two American waitresses.
Nick has been successful in business. He owns a house and lot in New York City and a lot at Carolina Beach. He was naturalized while in New York, but he has never married. He says that there are more jobs, more money, and a much easier life in every way in this country.
