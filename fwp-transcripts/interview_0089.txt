ISAAC SLAUGHTER
Isaac Slaughter said: I wuz borned on March 15, 1845, in Greensboro, Georgia, the slave of John I. Slaughter. This is what my sister, Dosha, says in the family Bible. Slater Dosha, she lives in Dadeville, Alabama, and she is one and one-half years older than me. I was on Flint River in Georgia daring the Civil War, and lawse, de sights I did see! I seed men and hawses laying all around no dead, and I wnz scared jest 'bout half to death "
"Now, papa, be careful what you tell, you know yo' don't want to be tellin' things what ain't true." admonished his daughter, Tura. With this Slaughter hushed his war tales.
"Well, we moved to Dadeville, Alabama, from Georgia with de Slaughters, and dey's a place called Slaughter's Crossing there now, I recollects and my sister, Dosha, she still lives there. I's got two sisters and two brothers living yet. I reckon Haven't heard from then in a long time but I recollect as how some of the folks would have writ if they wus any of then dead. My sister, Sophia, lives in Birmingham, but lawse have mercy me, child. I haven't seed her in a long, long time."
"Well, Slaughter, where did you come from when you moved here?"
"I's done moved here from Fort Payne, Alabama, in 1891. I's worked on de railroad when I's over in Fort Payne. I's worked at de ice plant when I's first come here, and den I done started to butchering for Mr. Ciders. I's lived at de slaughter pen and raised sheep, pigs and cattle for Hr. Ciders to kill. Don't guess you remember Mr. Ciders, but you daddy do. Den I'se butchered for different ones up to the last few years. But now I isn't able to lift de meat and handle hit."
For many years Slaughter has been familiar figure around Bridgeport in his ragged clothing, stained with blood from his butchering, and generally, about ten or twelve dogs following him, because of the blood and neat odor about him. Since he has stopped butchering the dogs do not follow his as they did. He is familiarly known as "Slaughter." Many people do not know that his real name is Slaughter, but think he derived his name from his profession as a butcher.
"What do you do now since yon have stopped slaughtering!"
"Well, Missus, I jest raises little track patches. I grown all kinds of vegetables, and year before last I growed some cotton; but die last year I didn't grow no cotton. I don't use no plow for to break my ground, but just digs it up wid a spade."
"How much ground do you have? "
"I trucks about three lots, and I wuz 'bout to forgit to tell you 'bout my pigs. I raised me one pig for our own use and sold one little pig, and had one to die. You see, Missus, I gathers up slop at the stores obery mornin', and one of ay little pigs, I knows, got a fish bone and got choked on hit."
“Do you own your own home?"
"My daughter, Tura here, she own die place."
Tura and Slaughter live in a little four-room frame house, which is painted white, trimmed in green, with flowers and shrubbery around it. When you enter the house you go into the living room, which contains an overstuffed living room suite, wool rug and floor lamp. The walls are papered, and lace ourtains, stiffly starched, hang from the windows.
Slaughter's room contains a wicker living room suite, white bed, round table, buffet and ourtains. This room has lineleum on the floor, and a chura of milk was setting by the fireplace on the hearth. In one corner of the room on a couch is a bunch of old magasines and pictures. The daughter pointed these out to me and said, "That is papa's playhouse. He gets all den books and pictures out every, night 'fore he goes to bed and looks at den." His pipes are among the collection. From my position I could see into the kitchen, and could see an electric stove and a linoleum on the floor, and a porcelain top table. Some one gave a rap at the front door about this time.
"Well, bless your heart, come right in oat of that snow."
"I want you to come and work for me today," came the reply from a white visitor.
"Lawse how me, child, I jest can't today."
"Oh, now Tura you just must come and help me out."
"Why, honey, if you could see dam seven shirts I's got to iron, and a washin' to do besides dat! Wuz you done be lookin' for company, or what you done want me to do?"
"I just wanted you to wash my dishes and clean my two rooms for,
"Wall, can't I come 'bout one o'clock and get dat done all right?"
They agreed after some talk for Tura to go at one o'clock and do the housework.
It was finally revealed by Tura that her husband, John Berry, was killed during the World War in France, and she got a pension from the Government. She is one of the best practical nurses in town, and this enables her to live very, comfortably.
"Slaughter, what time do you get up every morning?"
"I don't have no special time to git up. Sometimes I gits up 'bout 3:30 and sometimes 'boat 4:30. I jest gets up and builds me a fire and looks at my picture books until daylight, and den I goes to town and gathers up my slop, and den I comes back and eats my breakfast and goes up in de field and builds me a fire and starts diggin’ in my ground. "
'What church do you belong to?'
"I belongs to do primitive Baptist, but I been a member for ober twenty-five years. I wants to say dat my long life, I thinks, has been due to not eating much meat, don't drink coffee or any other kind of strong drink. I neber hab laid out at night or exposed myself. The only time I been exposed to de weather is working. Most of my eating is buttermilk and cornbread and some light bread. I won't eat without my milk. I drinks my buttermilk three times a day, with sugar in it. If I eats three times a day, de sugar bowl hab to be filled three times.'
Tura said, 'That's the onliest thing papa is extravagant about is his sugar and candy. Twenty-five cents worth of sugar won't last us a week, and papa kin eat twenty-five cents worth of candy any day, and he hain't got a tooth in he head. I don't think its wasteful though, long as he enjoys it like he do."
"Do you own a cow?"
"No, I'm just milking this one for a neighbor who is away. I'm going to try and buy her if she will let me."
"I guess I'm de oldest person in town,' Slaughter said," and can see jest as good as anybody without glasses. Guess I must hab my, second eyesight, case I can remember when long tins age I couldn't see so well. My hearin's good toe. Most that's wrong wid me is jest old age."
We were again interra ted by a knock at the door.
"Why, come right in. Uncle Arthur. Did you have a nice Christmas?" “Yes, yes, did you-all? Did Nora (Slaughter's granddaughter) come down for Christmas?"
"Yes, she and her old man just come down and spent tha day. Did you find your folks all well?"
"No, two of dem was sick in bed."
With this much said Uncle Arthur lapsed into silence and they again turned to me as if ready to resume the conversation.
"Do you have any more childran?"
"Yas'um, Missus, I's got two more daughters, Alice and Mary. Dey done lib in Kansas City, and I's had one son, Barl. He's been dead for thirty-two years."
"Where is your dog, Slaughter?"
"Well, Missus, since you wuz done ober here before, and made my, picture wid kaye, a car done runned ober him and killed him. I shore is glad dat you made our picture and done brought me one, case I dida't hab no picture of kaye I's still got my old big "Muffy," cat though, and also get as twenty hens."
"Say, Missus, what's wrong wid Alabana dat dey don't gib de old felks no pension?"" Here Uncle Arthur chimad in, "Ah done thought dat's what she wus doing here wus to see 'bout you a pension. "
"Alabama does pay some of the old people a pension, some of them in Jackson country get $6.00 per month, but you must make application in Scottsboro for this."
"Lawse how mercy, I wish I could get $6.00 a month. Den maybe I wouldn’t hab to dig so hard in de g round for a living."
"What time do you go to bed at night?"
"Sometimes I goes to bed 'bout 7:30 and sometimes not 'til 8:30 or 9 o'clock."
Tura said "Papa plays in his playhouse obery night and sets in front of de fire in his chair, dat's his chair specially„ See, it's a little low chair, and he's low, so he sets in it all de time. He smokes his pipe and tings."
"What does he sing?"
"All kind of songs."
"Could you give me one of them?"
"In a weak voice he murmured the following song:
“I’m gonna be on de battlefield
“I’m gonna be on de battlefield
“I’m gonna be on de battlefield
“I’m gonna be on de battlefield
Till I die
Till I die
Till I die
Till I die
I'm gonna keep my father's will till I die
I'm gonna keep my father's will till I die
I'm gonna keep my father's will till I die
I'm gonna keep my father's will till I die
I'm going down the valley to pray,
I'm going down the valley to pray
I'm going down the valley to pray
I'm going down the valley to pray,
I'm gonna treat my neighbors right Lord
I'm gonna treat my neighbors right Lord
I'm gonna treat my neighbors right Lord
I'm gonna treat my neighbors right Lord
Till I die
Till I die
Till I die
Till I die
"Dat las' an kinda hard to do sometimes."
"I had better be going", I said,"as Tura has so much work to de, she will never get through."
"Don't worry 'bout dat, chile," she said, "I’s sorry I can't think of no more to tell you 'bout papa. I mean to make a trip down to Dadeville and find out all I can 'bout him and see dat family, Bible. If I find out any, more I'll let you know. I shore do thank you for dat picture of papa. It shore do look jest like him. I will hab to send it to his granddaughter, Nora, in Chattanooga to see, and she can send it back to me."
By this time we were at the front door.
'Well, missus, I's glad you done come to see us, but I hates to see you out in die snow and cold weather. Be comin' back, and if us this of anything else I will come ober and tell you. Ten night go ober and see Aunt Ann and Aunt Molly, kellson and Aunt Bocky Reed: day are all old Negroes and night tell you lots of things dey can 'member a long time back."
