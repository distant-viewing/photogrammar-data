"A WAITRESS CONFESSES"
"The trouble wif dis damn job is, dere is too many reg'lar custermers an not enough folks jest droppin in to eat----'Hell, dere's one now,' snapped Swannee as she moved off to wait on a short fellow sitting at a side table. 'See, he's a guy dat eats here all de time. Ain't tipped me since Easter. He tips us all every holiday. Den he gives us a quarter a piece. Guess he thinks he's doin' sumthin', but dat ain't a damn thing--- A quarter at Chris'mas an one at Easter. Since dat time he ain't even said thank you. You see how much time an pains I took wif'im; jest threw de stuff on de table an walked away.
"Mr. Sampson gits mad if you take more pains wif some folks dan you do wif others. But you let me git a party dat looks purty good----J take special keer wif dere food an service too. He kin go ravin' mad fer all I keer. Most of de orcoster mens eat here when dey come to town. Jest de other day I served Ray Nolan. Him an his orcoster tipped good. Ray tipped me seventy- five cents an sit at de counter to eat when he coulda been settin' at a table an been more comferable. De other thirteen gimme twenty-five cents a piece. All together I got fo' dollars out'er de party. But dat hardly ever happens. If you ever wanna job, don't wait tables----here anyway.
"It's a nice place, yeah. In fact it's too nice. De folks dat comes here is nice, but if dey got any money dey shore keeps it. Dat is dey don't spend it fer tips. I'b worked in both kinds of cafes an I'b found out dat it's de trashy folks tips de best. Dey come in tight an tips you two or three times fer de same service sometimes, but dese folks is too dikty to git high, derefore dey don't tip much. You see de tighter de head gits, de looser de purse strings is. I guess dey feels kinda reckless, but it shore makes de waitress feel good.
"Course you kin make purty good on dates if you'se nice looking an wants to. Dey puts out good money on sport when dey takes you out on parties. I use to go a lot, but I got tired of dat. You kin git off easy though if you know de ropes. All you have to do is tell'im you want some liker an git'im drunk. Then you kin git your money an he won't be no trouble atall.
"You know when de orcoster mens come, dey ask me about steppin' out fer de night; an ask if I could find some more 'chicks'. I told um dat I had a date but I could find um some other girls. I called Clem. I knowed she'd go an find some others too. Now dat woulda been a big night. We'da had a big night, an made good too. I shore hated to miss dat, but my study frein' wuz comin' in town dat night.
"But let me tell you about Rocky---dat's what we call Mr. Sampson cause he's so hard. He's a dog! jest today he ask one of de waitresses: 'How's your thing today'? Right out loud---an other folks wuz around too. He tries all of de girls an ez soon ez he gits um, he don't won't um no more. Sometime he fires um right off de bat an when he don't, he's so mean to um dat dey soon leave. Den when dey don't come across he fires um userally. He didn't git me though. He wuz too ankchous. I wuz too smart fer'im. See, I lived in Noo York a long time an worked on de stage, so I knowed a lotta ways to git by'im. I didn't tell'im at first dat I wouldn't. I ask'im what wuz in it. He said, 'Well, you'll be shore of your job.' I said: 'What's a damn job? I got one already an if I lose it, I kin git another.' Still actin' like I might consider it.
"Fer several days he ain't said no more. Guess he wuz thinkin' it over. De other girls had been so easy dat I guess I kinda knocked 'im off his feets. Den one day he called, 'Let's have lunch while you ain't busy.' 'O. K.,' I said an brung in lunches fer two. When we wuz eatin' he said, 'I been thinkin' about our talk de other day----tell you whut, I'll give you a dollar raise; whatcha say?' I said, 'Dat's chicken feed. You'll hafter make it more attractiff or I'll hafter need it mighty bad. Now I don't need nothin' fer my health.' He jest looked at me and glowed, but said nothin' more dat day. I wuz stallin' fer time. He kep me cause he thought I would go wid'im if his terms wuz attractiff enouf; he wuz too cheap to bring his price up.
"Dis job only pays fo' measley dollars a week an mabbe you git fo' dollars in tips. Dat's fer a avrage of 'leven hours a day. One day we works ten hours an de next day we works twelve. Some weeks de tips is more an some weeks dey is even less. One week I only got a dollar an forty cents. Dat is, in tips.
"I kin wait tables fast when I wants to. You know, we don't have no special tables, we jest wait on anybody dat comes in if we ain't busy. I could make good money if de folks I waits on would jest tip me. I shore waits on enouf in a day.
"I eats on de job but I has to pay three dollars a week fer de room rent. I couldn't live on dat, but you see, when I first come South, I had a little dough an I'd pinch off it to add to whut I made an whut I could pick up. I kep a using a little at a time till 'twas all gone. I couldn't git by on my salary. The money to be picked up on dates wuz not certin, an most of all I didn't wan't Rocky. Dere's some men you jest see an right away you wants um; den dere's some you jest see an right away you hates um, an wants sream when dey come near you. Dat's de way I am by Rocky. It ain't much dat anybody's gonna git out of Rocky any way. So I begin lookin' fer a better job. I thought 'twould be easy to find one waitin' but it twon't; an I can't do many kinds of work good.
"One night I dressed my best an went in a joint to ask fer work. It wuz a crowded, smoky place an de air wuz filled wif de odor of fish. I wuz turnin' to leave when a tall fellow of 'bout thirty-five years caught my arm; an thinkin' dat I wuz leavin' 'cause all de tables wuz took said, 'You kin sit here if you like, lady.' I thanked 'im an sit down. We tole each other our names. His'n wuz Josh. He ask, 'Wouldja like to have a beer?' I says, 'Don't keer if I do.' So we drinked de beer an talked.
"Soon I found myself tellin' im all a my bizness jest like I'd always knowed im. He listened an said nothin'. I guess we wuz talkin' fer two hours or more. When I wuz through, he said, 'You don't want to work in dis place. Where ya live?' I tole im an he took me home. You know he wuz rilly nice. He wanted to come to see me agin an I let im. He come several nights. Den one night he lowed, 'Swannee, gosh;I like you. I tell you what---you need help an I do too; so you be nice to me an I'll help ya.' I did need help an I liked 'im anyway, so I said, 'It's a go.' After all you hafter have someone to haul your ashes. Dat next day he moved me to another room, he'd rented fer me. He libs an works in Rosenville, dat's only 'bout an hour's ride from here. Course he comes some nights an stays, den some nights he don't; but you never know when he is or ain't comin'.
"He buys my clothes, pays de rent, buys my jewerally,----'See my watch an rings,' commanded Swannee displaying a yellow gold watch, and a wedding band and engagement ring set of the same material. He also give's me money each week. I puts dat in de bank an my salary too. Alreddy I got most two hundred dollars saved in my own name; see?" confided Swannee pullin' her bank book out of an inside pocket and displaying it proudly. "I has it wif me cause dis is my day to bank some more. Only one fault I find wif Josh, he's jelous ez 'lasses is sticky. He gits mad if a man looks at me even cockeyed. But I guess you can't git everthin' good in one man. I ain't done much cheatin' since I been goin' wif 'im either.
"Several weeks later, Rocky 'proached me ag'in. 'Well, I guess I'm reddy to bargin wid you; whatcha want?' says he. 'Not a damn thing,' I said, 'I'm not fer sale.' Den he said, 'Oh no? you could git fired talkin' so big.' 'I don't need your confound job noway; go on an fire me,' Swannee said that she told him. "But he ain't yet an dat wuz most three months ago."
"Why don't you marry this man since he is so nice to you?"
"I can't marry Josh 'cause I been married alreddy an I can't git a revorce; dat is King won't give me nare'n. I wuz tryin' to get one from him once before but de lawyer said that he contested it.
"I wuz married fer four years 'fore we parted and we been separated five years. Dat's when I went on de stage.
"Now dat's a racket worse den waitin'. I wuz a chorus girl de whole five years. When I'd work I'd git twenty-five dollars a week. Sometime I'd work fer months at de time, den bizness would fall off an mebbe I'd be out of work for months at a time. One year work wuz good an' I made most every week. You'd think I woulda saved some but I couldn't or wouldn't. You see we stayed on de job from 'leven in de mornin' to twelve at night, even though we'd only be on de stage 'bout an hour. All dat time de troupe would drink an' gamble backstage. At first I wouldn't, take a part, but dey called me cream puff, and said I wuz a poor sport. So to be sociable I begin chippin' in an'helpin' to buy de liker. Den I decided dat I may as well drink sum if I wuz helpin' to buy it. Dat's how I started drinkin'. You know I drunk so much liker dat I got to de place whar I jest could stay on the stage fer fifteen minets. Soon ez I'd come off de first thing wuz to git a swig of liker. I still likes my liker, too, but Josh, he don't let me drink much.
"De gamblin' come on 'bout ez easy. I remember de first time I gambled I won a lotta dough an dat wuz incuragement to keep on. After dat dey considered me a reg'lar gal; but I wuz always broke when I'd finish playing. Some weeks I'd lose all of my money. Every week I'd lose some.
"Den they'd be parties at night clubs after de show an you jest had to go. Once you'd git started, keepin' it up was easy. I hardly ever got any rest. Dat's why I come South fer a while. I planned to rest up an go back, but now I changed my mine. Dis is my home anyway.
"I wuz born right here in Tannerton, dat is bout two miles from dere, in 1910. Dere wuz six of us, four girls an two boys. One of my sisters is dead though. I wuz de third oldest child. Dere is two girls older den me. Dey're married now, one ain't got no chillun and de other's got five. Glad twon't me. I ain't never had none an don't want none. They hold you back too much. I always wuz cereful not to have any. Poor folks don't need none. Dey have to suffer too much. Dey ain't much money dat we'uns kin make. Most of de time we makes jest enouf to git by on ourselves, an if we hafter vide dat wif a parcel of chillun, den none of us gits enough, You'd think det de more hans dere wuz to work de more money you'd have comin' in, but dat ain't so hardly. Dere'se so many folks needin' work an such a few jobs dat dey jest don't git aroun'.
"Now take Ma an Pa----Dey had all 'a us. Dey wuz jest poor farmers. Dey couldn't suport a parcel of younguns right, dey jest could feed us. None of us got any edjecation to mount to nothin'. I went de highest. I finished de sixth grade. I never will fergit dem days when we went to dat school house. It wuz a one room school, wif benches like church benches, dat sit up on a hill in de purtiest grove of pine trees. I don't know much from de books though, cause Pa wouldn't let us stay in school but bout four months a year, but I got a gang of common hoss sense. Pa put us all in de fields to help earn our keep, ez he called it, after I went through de sixth grade. Him an Ma couldn't read ner write; an he didn't want us to learn neither. He said twould only swell our heads an we could work better widout books fillin' our minds.
"We worked hard on de farm Pa rented, but it kept goin' down. Dere wuzn't money to buy enouf manure to put to de bacco an cotton. Dat wuz all we raised cept peanuts. Each year we'd rais less'n less. We'd always go in de hold an dere wouldn't be enouf money to pay bills much less buy de things we'd need. Dat wuz enouf to discourage a body and it shore did discourage Pa. He begin drinking heavy. Him an Ma most never got along. Den he took to beatin' er so she took us chillun an left im. Now she's married ag'in, an Pa, he died two months ago.
"Right after we moved from Pa, we faired rail hard. Ma, she'd work an hire us out by de day helpin' on anybody's place dat'd work us. My two sisters got married dat next year, one to a sharecropper an de other'n to another farm boy but dey went North to live. Dey works in service now. I went to Noo York dat same summer. Dat's where I met King an married 'im right off de bat. He's in de undertakin' bizness. He wuz a good provider ez fer ez food an' clothes an' a place to sleep wuz concerned, but he never gimme no money to spend. Guess he had too many womens fer dat. Anyway he stayed out all night most every night an when he come home he wuz always broke; so I left im fer de stage.
"Dat life is too hard. I think I stay in de Souf if I kin stand dese damn jim crow laws. Dey ain't nothing but a mess. You can't go dis place an you can't go dat place an dere ain't nothing or no place fere respectable folks to go and do.
"You know, I hates waitin' on other folks, I'm jest doing dis fer a point. Course I needed it bad when I took it--see dere aints much I kin do. I plans to keep dis job fer a while if ole Rocky don't fire me. Ever woman wants a little change of her own now'n den. You see I'm takin' beauty culture course at night an I'm saving my money. When I finishes it, I want to open me up a shop of my own. Dat's why I'm savin' my money. See I'm twenty nine years olds now an by de time I'm thirty-five, I intends to be somebody all set up in bizness.
"You see, I wants money comin' in steddy dats all my own. I wants to dress better an go to church more, an be spectable. Course I ain't been in a long time but I'm a baptiz'--wouldn't be nothin' else: You'se one ain'tcha? Lawd dats too bad. Better git to be a baptis'. Dat's de only right way. Course I ain't joined here yet, but jest de same I been a baptis' a long time. Trouble wif most folks is, dey spends too much time talkin' bout politics an de way de white folks is runnin' de government. Politic's alright fer white folks, but dey don't help us none, so I don't waste my time runnin' to de poles. Here de other day sum of my friens wuz ruahin' to vote like dey'd miss something if dey didn't git there, but not me cause I knowed twon't gonna help me none. Guess dey thought twould makeum look big. Dey never rush to de church like dat.
"O let me tell you--I'm gonna git off fer two weeks this summer. See, Josh,---dat's my boy friend-- is gonna take me on a rail vacation. We're goin' to Noo York to de world's fair. I'm jest tickled pink cause I ain't never had whut you call a vacation. I been places but I always had to work. Dis time it different. Josh is gonna buy my clothes an pay my expenses on de trip. All I gotta do is pay $12---dat's fer my railroad fare up dere an back on de excursion. He says he ain't gonna do dat. But dat's easy. I kin save my salary fer three weeks an have it. Den if I need any more spending change while I'm savin' dat, all I have to do is to ask'im fer it.
"Tis easy to git lost in Noo York city. So I don't mind King being dare. We'll just room in Brooklyn an he lives up in Harlem. But ain't dat a lovely trip, an me not having to spen' no money.
"If my health keeps good ez it has been--let me knock on wood--I know I kin soon save a neat sum. I ain't never been rail sick cept fer thingschillun is s'posed to have like measles, chickenpox, mumps, smallpox an colds. Alla us wuz purty healthy an strong, thank God. One thing now, I tries to be keerful an eat de things I know I oughta eat. I knows now what dey are from workin' in cafes; an whether I likes um or not, I makes myself eat some. I learned to eat a lotta vegetables and cerels dat way. Course I always did like meat, bread an fruit.
"Gosh, I didn't know I'd talked dia long. Tis time I wuz fixing salads fer dinner. What'll Rocky say?
"Well goo'by. I'd like to talk wif you ag'in. I live on Keystone Street, but I don't wantcha to come to see me. It ain't nice enouf. 'Tis kinda rough down dere. Course I kin take cere of myself, but I'm not sure dat anybody else kin. Tell you what; you tell me where you live an I kin come to see you some day."
