IF 'TIS GOD'S WILL
Eula Warner knelt beside a tub in a small but pretty bathroom, washing the week's laundry. "Have a seat dere in de hall where it's cool. I kin talk to you dere an' kin wash at de same time. I'll be through in a little while, if 'tis God's will. I likes company when I works. Time seems to pass much faster. Work is de most pleasantest, comfortableest, thing 'tis in de whole world. I shore likes to work; allus did. I never could sit around an' loaf like some folks kin. 'Tis a good thing I does too. I don't know what would've happened to me if'n I hadn't liked work. 'Cause Jim an' me's been parted so long now, most sixteen years an' I's worked dest 'bout ever' one of dem days since den. De work's been hard, but I liked it. I wus glad to find something to do to take care of de boy an' me.
"You know, I rather wash an' cook dan do any thing I ever knowed. Course I have to set an' do most of my washing now--I used to see Ma set down an' do her work, an' I would think, 'Lord, I'd rather do de work an' git through wid it, dan to piddle along all de day jest to set down In' work.' I didn't know den dat she'd worn herself out, slaving fer us chillun. Now I kin see how she felt.
"We had a big family. Dere wus twelve of us chillun besides Pa an' Ma. Pa never made much. He farmed, you know, on de share crop Basin Course now, him an' Ma's been dead a long time.
"An old Irish woman showed me how to save myself an' git de clothes clean, too, when I wash, Dat year I wus up to Washington working. After she rubbed um clean on a washboard, she'd put um in de other tub an' open um up an' sqush um good. Den she'd run dat water off, an' put in some fresh water. She'd sqush um out'er dat water an' run it off. Well in de next water, she'd stir um round an' wring um out. All de soap would be out of um an' dey'd be jest ez white ez snow.
"I went up to Philadelphia to visit my brother John once. Dat wus before I wus married. I shore liked dat place. I didn't git to stay but two years 'cause Ma took deathly sick, an' I had to come home an' nurse her. She wus sick a long time, poor thing. After she died, I got married to a home boy an' never got back up dere.
"I married Jim Warner. He come from a good family an' a right rich un too. His pa owned a big farm in Sandridge, an' wus deacon of de White Hall Baptist Church fer close nigh thirty years. He shore wus a good man if dere ever wus one. Course he's dead now too.
"Now Jim, he never would save. He wus a farmer too. Course we didn't own our farm like his pa did. Jim would never save anything to start buying a farm wid. We rented a little farm on de percentage basin, an' got our share each. One thing though, we didn't have any trouble keeping a farm. We stayed on de same farm de whole twelve years dat I lived wid him. You know some people has to move 'bout ever' year fer some reason or 'nother. Jim wus a smart man; he jest didn't spend his money fer things dat he needed after he made it. He got his part of de money too. Mr. Bell, dat's de man who owned de land, wus a mighty nice an' fair person. He never tried to cheat us. He couldn'ta if he'd tried, 'cause we allus put down ever' penny we borrowed or spent on de farm. But Mr. Bell wus jest a christian, white gen'man.
"I hears 'bout folks gitting cheated out er all dere earnings by dere bosses. Dat's good enough fer um, I says, 'cause dey oughta be business like an' put on paper everything important jest like de white folks does.
"My whole life had been lived on de farm, so naturally I liked it fine. An' did I love Jim! He wus my whole life 'till he deceived me.
"Fer de first few years we did right well, an' got along fine. Den Jim took to cutting de fool. He jest got wild in ever' way. I wus slow in having my chillun, so I didn't have but two before Jim an' me parted. Dey wus both boys, thank God. I don't know what I'da done wid girl chillun all dese years, struggling like I's had to do.
"We wus married 'bout twelve years, before Jim got to running round so bad. Oat's when I up an' left 'im. I always said when a man gits to courting, jest let 'im court right on, out you git out an' leave 'im; no matter how much you love 'im, 'cause you can't stop 'im. It ain't no use to worry all your life; dis world's too large an' wide fer dat. Course you'se gonna worry some but in time you kin git over it wid a lotta hard work an' prayer, but if you keep on staying dere you not only worry out if you ain't keerful, he'll make you lose your soul.
"One of my boys died before I left Jim. De one we called Son, lived. I took him wid me when I left. He growed up to be a man an' a no good un at dat. He hardly ever works. Most of de time he jest bums around de country on trains an' things, Sometimes years pass an' I don't know where dat boy is. Den when he ain't tramping around de country, he's loafing somewheres. He's here in Spindale, but he don't help me none. He ain't never done one thing fer me but keep so worried to death, wondering where he is, how he is, an' what he's doing.
"Bon jest won't marry. He said he ain't seen no gals worth carrying. One thing, he started out so young. I jest couldn't do one thing wid 'im. He's too much like 'in pa. He's jest done run out; he ain't got no faith in none of em. An' he ain't studying 'bout no religion, poor boy. If 'tis God's will, I hopes he'll come to his censes an' git on de Lor'd side before it's too late. If he'd a' went on to heaven when de other'n did, he'd 'a been a lot better off dis morning an' so would I. He's most nigh worried me to death. Chillun is nice things, but dey is so wild dat dey gives dere was a whole lotts trouble.
"When I come to Spindale, I had jest left Jim. I been here over sixteen years. I don't know where he is now; or whether he's living or dead. But I been working study an' right hard too, all dose years, an' God hae she' blessed me to have good heath. Course I'se jest weared myself out now. I know dat, dat is why I'm allus siling.
"I still do's a little work, 'cause I gotta eat, but I don't allus be able. Let's see, I clean Dr. Terry's office, a lady's apartment, an' does general housework here fer Miss Janie. Dr. Terry said dat fer my age, I still needed to git more rest. He made me stay in de bed a month during de winter. He wants me to go back to bed now, out I hates de bed. I can't stay still. I likes to be up an' a-moving.
"I don't make much money now, since de doctor took me off of some of de work. Now I gits a little rest each day, after my work is done. I jest goes to clean Dr. Terry's office an' kiss Lucy's apartment ever' other day, an' gits fifty cents a week from each one of um. Course I lives wid Miss Janie, so I do something here ever' day ez I see de need of it; she gives me my room, board, an' a dollar a week, So you see I makes only $2 a week fer all three jobs. Buy dey's all mighty nice to me an' dat money helps me wid de little things dat I needs from time to time.
"I gits all dere old clothes an' stockings an' things. An' dey's plenty good enough fer me. See I ain't thinking 'bout no menfolks like most womens would be. I loved Jim, an' had a lot of confidence in im, den when he deceived me, he done me up so bad dat I ain't trusted a man since den.
"Men ain't no good. Dey's most all alike. De few dat's different is so scarce an' far between dat you couldn't find a good un in a sawdust pile. When Jim an' me parted, I decided den dat he wus de last man dat I'd be bothered wid, an' he is. Dat's de truth !
"De only thing I does besides work is to go to de church. I got a Sunday outfit dat I saves jest fer church, Yes, I goes to church an' lives right, ' cause if it's God's will, I aims to make heaven my home.
"I belongs to Shiloh Baptist Church but it's so far uptown, dat I don't go up dere much. I can't walk it no more, an' dere's a church out here near me, so I goes dere an' gives de Lord de carfare. I believes in giving de church its part. I wish I could do more. I goes to church ever' Sunday, 'cause I intends to jine dat heavenly choir some sweet day.
"We's all allus been Baptists. Me, my ma an' pa, Jim, his ma an' pa. But I think you kin live de life of God in any church. I don't believe dat you jest have to be a baptist to git to heaven, You Know dey ain't all Baptist folks dere.
"I used to belong to de Free Will Baptist back in Sandridge, bat since I come to Spindale, I ain't been able to find one. De only difference between um is dat de Free Will folks washes feet an' de church dat I goes to now don't. Dat won't keep you out of heaven no way. Den, too, I kin wash my feet at home. I takes a wash off ever' day God sends anyway. Ever'body oughta, ' cause if dey don't, up in de day dey begins to smell musty, wid de heat an' work too.
"If 'tis God's will, I'll be through dis washing in a hour. Lord, ain't it hot; an' I'm so tired Washing is much easier an' time seems to jest fly when you have someone to talk to while you works.
"You know, I wish I could git one of dem old folks pensions dey is giving out. I think dat when folks gits old an' worn out like I am, dey oughta git a little help. Wonder kin a person fifty-three years old git one? I wish dat you would find out fer me. Dey say dat when a person has worked dis long, dey oughta have enough saved to live on when dey gits old. But poor folks wid no ejecation, don't make enough to hardly live whilst dey is working; much less when dey ain't.
"I thinks it's a shame de way dese white folks treats de colored folks. Course it's better on us old folks 'cause we's use to it. But you all fares much better, at dat, dan we use to. When I wus a girl, I wus gitting forty cents a day an' thought dat I wus doing good. Now it costs more to live an' you younger folks needs more of everything dan we did. You know more an' de more you know de more you needs it seems to me.
"I don't know what to say 'bout ejecation, 'cause none of us ever had any to amount to anything, Seems to me though, dat ejecation don't do dese young folks much good nowadays. De more schooling dey gits, de wilder dey gits. I thinks dat schools would be fine if dey'd take a little common sense an' de Bible along wid it. But dey seems to fergit dat. Den a whole lotta de trouble is wid dese modern mothers. Dey rip an' tear so much deyselves, dat dey don't take no time to learn dere chillun no manners or nothing. Dey jest sends um to de school an' specks de teacher to make de chile from de start an' den learn um. Den when de teacher tries to help it, de chile either jumps up to fight de teacher or runs home an' tells de mother an' den she gits mad ez a wet setting hen an' bawls de poor teacher out. Lord, I know I jest couldn't teach if I had any ejecation.
"Well, I'm shore glad you come to see me. You know I got to talking to you, an' now here I am through washing, an' it don't seem no time at all. All I got to do is to hang out dese clothes- But let me tell you 'bout dis first.
"I hear all dis talk 'bout politics; I don't know nothing 'bout politics, but I do think that Roosevelt is doing a mighty fine job. But I don't like all dis war talk though. If dey have de war, I don't think dat de colored folks should oughta go. Dey got such a dirty deal in dis last war. De white peoples runs dis country an' takes de best of everything, so dey oughta do dere own fighting, I says.
"Not so long ago, dey tell me dat dey wus trying to run all de colored folks outter dis country--wanted to make um go to Africa--I heard Miss Janie an' her friends talking 'bout it. She's de lady I works fer, you know, an' lives wid. Now since all dis war talk is going on, I can't hear nothing 'bout us colored folks going to Africa. I guess dey decided to let us stay 'till after de war is over so our menfolks kin help um fight. Poor colored folks ain't got no home, so dey better stick close to de word an' try to make heaven dere home.
"Ez fer me, I'm gonna work on here an' stick close to de word, an' go to dat place of rest when I die, if His God's will."
