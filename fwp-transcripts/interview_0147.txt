"I was born in the year '63 in the town of Rumorose, one and a half leagues from Santander, Spain.
"I came to Mobile, Alabama, in the year '73. In Mobile I dedicated myself as waiter of a store and barroom. I went into business with a partner, who had barroom and billiard room. We had a beer war, and I came to Tampa in '89, in a schooner which was called "Lizzy Henderson". It disembarked at the mouth of the river.
"Afterwards I dedicated myself to making cigars for only one week. Later I was made foreman of the factory of Monet Hnos. That factory is known as Lovera. Later that factory closed because they worked only "pais" (1), and I went to work with Pendas & Co. until the year '92. In '93 I established myself in a barroom, and at the same time I ran for appraiser of taxes of the city, and was elected. The city had a valuation of three and a half millions of dollars. I continued in this until 1901, when I started in the business of warehouse in a wholesale way.
"Then I was elected member of Public Works for four years. I do not know if it will be Important, but at that time it was necessary to put up a bond of $20,000, which Mr. Pendas and Mr. Haya gave. This lasted until 1905.
(1) Tobacco grown in this country.
"I did not continue and kept in my business as wholesaler. In 1905 I made a combination of business with the brewery. At that time the brewery was completely broke. I made good business until 1909.
"In 1909 I retired from the brewery, and established myself in the wholesale liquor business. During this time when I had the warehouse, I had to have certain business houses so that they would consume the liquor. Each wholesaler had his. They constituted the customers.
"This lasted until the time of prohibition in 1918. After wards I retired from the business because the change of that politics, everything that one had was not worth anything. They confiscated you more than 95% of your investment.
"In these things there are opinions. My opinion was always, and is yet, that the evolution that was made to carry the country to prohibition, was not in reality the prohibition to the youths or to the family that they should obtain all the liquor desirable. They had the price to purchase it. My opinion is that it was an evolution of terrible reach. For example: 98% of the beer plants in the United States belonged to Germans; 95% of the refineries belonged to Jews; 90% of the importers were Spaniards, Italians, French and Germans. More than 90% of the retailers in liquor belonged to the nationalities expressed above, all foreigners.
"So that with that evolution called prohibition, they confiscated more than 95% of the investments of these foreigners. They annulled their political force, and prevented the immigration to continue favoring those industries. And very logical, the capital invested was very great of the referred investments. The number of employees was also very great, and as a consequence of this, they had an immense political force; and in many states this situation dominated. So that in carrying to effect the prohibitionistic part by means of the church, especially Inviting the vote of the women, who then began to have the right to vote, financially helping these churches, so that under the flag of prohibition, and protection of the families, they should do as they did: their campaign in favor of prohibition during a time when there were more than three million soldiers out of the country. That is my opinion.
"The clergy of the different denominations, excepting the catholic, who have never meddled in anything, are ignorants, who meddle in political and civil business, or in any other affair which is not the common sense of the denomination. They get before the pulpit and cry out against anything and everything.
I do not profess any other religion than the Catholic, which was the one my fathers taught me over there in Spain. I admire the Catholic religion.
"When I had been eleven years in my town, I was an acolyte. I knew how to sing, and at the beginning of my eleventh year, every time I went to church, that incense would make me dizzy as even here when I went as a pallbearer; whenever they would light the Incense, it would give me a headache, and I had to leave immediately. I believe in religion only up to a certain point.
"I was at Sevilla at the inauguration of Alphonso XII. Martinez Campo proclaimed him King in the year '74.
"I was married in Jacksonville, Florida, in the year'90. We had one girl and two boys. The two boys are still living.
"Olendorf, a grammar of English and Spanish and pronunciation -- that was my school. From that I learned the little that I know. In Spain it is impossible to study as when one has 18 years, they take you to serve the fatherland, and only children and old people remain, who cannot work. So one must work ever since one is a child.
"In order to put someone in your place to serve, one must pay $300.00. There is no manner of escaping, even though one is here. If one is not in Spain, they will make the family responsible. It is necessary to serve, that is all they understand, and there are no excuses of any kind that are valid.
"I was made honorary member of the Spanish Club. I hold number 2 as one of its founders. I have just received the letter from the "Centro" advising me of this. It was already time.
"I gave many cocktails to Theodore Roosevelt when he was camped here in Tampa. He had enormous horses. He marched through 7th Avenue, which at that time was a sandy waste. There was no pavement nor anything. Many times he would order a halt, and would make the horses kneel down. The General Headquarters was at the Tampa Bay Hotel. The commanding officer was Myles, an enormous man. He looked like a savage. What a man!"
