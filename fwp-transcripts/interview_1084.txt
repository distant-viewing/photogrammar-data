"Give me that old-time religion
Give me that old-time religion
Give, me that old-time religion
Its good, enough for me.
It was good for my old pappy
It was good for my old pappy
It was good for my old pappy
Its good enough for me.
It was good for my old mammy
It was good for my old mammy
It was good for my old mammy
Its good enough for me.
This hymn isn't exactly the theme song of Sister Marie Brown, a happy, dark religious child, but she sings it all the time, mainly because, "this new religion is so streamlined that you don't know if you is prayin’ to the Lawd or to the preacher,” Marie had been a christian nearly all of her sixty years. Of course, she has "backslided” like other christians, but it was only in the mind; she says," there I was thinking like I always do. And I figures that everything is in the mind, aint it? Alright, take the other day. Didn't I want to take a drink. I took it. My mind says I didn't feel it, so I took so more, Then I took some more, for I knowed it I was dead drunk. Then, I makes up my mind that I aint drunk, and I starts to drink some more, cause my mind says I aint drunk. Then, I gets drunk for true. Now, if I didn't listen to my mind I wouldn't er got drunk." And, "Thats the way religion is, your minds gets you and there you is." Marie took a comfortable seat in her rocking-chair upon completing this last charge, urging," just git yourself tired up in your church and your mind takes you away, plum away. I always say your mind is like a sailor, it likes to travel. Sometimes it takes me to Africa.
"I came hyar from De Ridder about twenty yars ago. Sometimes I ask myself why I came hyar, cause I was doing all right in De Ridder. I was working on the farm, cose I wasn't making much money, but I was doing all right. Sho, I was a christian then. Let me tell you, when I furst opened my eyes on glorified day I was a christian. My ma and my pa ahead of me was christians. They was members of the One Light Baptist Church. Why they calls it One Light Baptist Church? Cause the church only had one light, thats all. But, one, two or three lights, the Lawd came to it just the same. He would sing Give Me That Old Time Religion,’ Anyhow, whats the light got to do with your religion? Aint religion light? The Bible says so. Sometimes the Bible is mis-quoted, "but not about light. Even when our lamp used to go out we had still had the Lawd. Ha-ha! That reminds me, all of us hollowed 'the light done gone out,' but Henry Jones says, 'thats nothing, the Lawd is in our church.' Then Napoleon Jackson says, 'the Lawd nothin’ some nigger's hand is in my pocket.' Talking about a scuffle, man that was some scuffle! People commenced talking about if anybody's hand is in my pocket its coming up a nubb! Shucks, I sat down on my money. And 'do you know that somebody tried to get my money. Old Rev. Kept pounding on his Bible, asking for the lights but the lights aint never oame on. Man, we had to run out of church. So, Old Rev. stopped that kind of stuff, he got him one of them great big lights and stuck it up by him on the pulpit; got him three big lights for the congregation, was she pisitve that no more lights was going out, no indeed! But, they aint never changed the name of the church. My pa used to say all the time that they ought-a change them lights and get oil, but the people was soared that oil might set the church on fire; and there it would be! So, we didn't argue about no light, we just went a-head and satisfied ourselves with one light, and had our services.
"Another time, I went to Sister Brooks' house and told her that it was a shame that the collections was so small, but she didn't say nothing but that it was due to the lights. you see, nobody could see the basket plain enough. Them collectors used to always complain that they couldn't tell what was being dropped in the basket, it was hard to tell when the dimes, nickels and pennies was being dropped. Old lady Lulu used to say all the time that heaven was light and she saw no reason why there wasn't no light in the church. No, aint none of them lights failed much, but they did fail. No, we aint stop going to church cause the services was good. Our preacher she could preach. His name was Paul Rivers. He was long and tall; And could that rascal preach! Man, old Rev. used to stand on the pulpit and open, his big mouth; he used to dig in the Bible like a man digs in the ground with a pitchfork. Every time he came up them sinners used to fall out. Talking ah out fried chicken, man, them sisters told old Rev. 'knock me out and get chicken.' Well, there wasn't no need talking that old Rev. couldn't preach, he could lay it. Take the time he had baptism in the river. Old Rev. said he was going to get him some sinners. He went down to the river and looked at the water, told the water to hash cause he had words to speak. And do you know that the waters hashed? Them waters stopped just as dead as dead! Even looked up at old Rev. He got to preaching! 'Breathern and sisterern, hyar I'm, standing on the rock of ages, standing hyar and looking direct Into the space of hemiphere and glory, asking to be hyared so a message can be both understood and relayed to the four corners of the world. Help me, and untask me so that I can preach this gospel. Yes suh, old Rev. had some preaching 'bility. He could make people fall in the water. I fell in there when I went to see the "baptism of my uncle Jake. I couldn't swim but the spirit lifted ma out of the water, and my body was dry like my soul. It, was dry with the blessing of the Lawd. Old Rev. kept on saying, 'Taking my text from the first end of Jerimiah to the last of David. David said, 'speak not maliciously of no one unless that someone falls prey to wrong. It makes no sense? In other words, we must not speak less we know of who we speak, and that person must be in bad shape, in other words in a wreckless state, and is such a bad thing in the community that talk won't hart. Thats why old Rev. used to talk on 'Sinning for security all the time.'nCose, I aint never done it, but old Rev. was talking about a gal named Helen. She used to sin for security. Old Rev. used to talk about her all the time. I used to wonder why he talked so much about Helen. But, I found out that he tried to sin with Helen but he aint had no security. And she wasn't going for the fun of it. So, old Rev. said he was going to make her get religion, cause it was a sin and a shame the way Helen was knocking the church business away from the deacons' board. Before every deacon paid his church dues he was paying his dues to Helen. Old Rev. would take for his text all the verses of David, and talk straight to the people, 'Must we sin? Must we? Isn't s it a fact that sins puts us in the middle of the devil's door? Aint it a fact that sins offers us no real security? because sins tells us that we is when we aint. Somttimes we feel lak we is enjoying something, but we aint. We is just sining, thats all. Facts, David says we must not sin less the lions of the woods grabs us by our throats and tie us down to make us sin.' Is you asking when is that? That is...well, I can't explain that. It aint lak me to talk that kind of talk, is it? I'm a lady. Then again, I don't know techinally when that is. I'M only thinking. You can he wrong in your thinking, you know. Anyway, old Rev. used to say when womens get so they aint got no respect for the ways mens agree on them, they aint got no rights to be respected. But, Helen didn't care, she went on and got plenty security. Used to say all the times, 'aint the lights in the church going out all the time? If them lights can go out why not mine? Lights is lights. Aint nobody ever said nothing about lights in the church going out, is they?’ That was a question that nobody could answer. I used to try and figure that out myself, but I couldn't do it for nothing in the world. Old Rev. used to look at Helen, she was some brownskin gal, and shake hisnhead. 'Let him preach about sinning for security all he wants, but if it wasn't for that church what security would he have?' She used to say. And don't you know that that was a fact, if it wasn't for that church what would he do. Cose, myself I was a christian, and I wasn' never going to say nothing about Helen. My mammy used to tell me all the time to never say nothing about Helen. Cause as she long as she wasn't taking my pa itvwas all right with us. It was strange thing my pa never stand Helen. Not, I don't know why he didn't lak her. I don't reckon that it was because there was anything between them, neither. My pa was just a straight-up old man, thats all. He went straight. I know cause he supported the church; used to give old Rev. vegatables. He had that old time religion, and plenty of it.
"Take the lights and Helen and Jim Bailey. All of them was bad. Jim Bailey was an old rascal too. He used to work on the railroads and buy womens all the nice things. But they way he didn't pest them was a shame. Jim used to pick the womens up and out right out of church. Used to always say, 'if they can shout they can jump, and if they can jump they can squall lak a pig, and I lak a pig what can equal lak a pig.’ that One Light Baptist Church was a mess! Old Rev. used to say all the time, 'Church aint a place for the wealthy and the people who want to have fun, its a place for righteousness and uplifting souls.’ I don't know if that was right or not, I'm a christian and it aint my plaoe to know that. Not that I'm no doubting Thomas or nothing. He did all his talking, but if he could help Hein sin for security he would er done son long ago. That goes for all them preachers, make no difference where they is. I'm a christian. But, I done dipped my nose into that long ago. How I got religion? I don't know, but I she beleives that my ma and pa gave it to me before I was born. Cause I came hyar talking about the Lawd, they says it right that I should stay a christian. I always sing that old time religion, it keeps me from getting a-hold to the new kind. The kind that gives you all preacher and no Gawd. Me, I’m she going to protect myself from the devil by singing my hymn and minding my business. Me, I don't know nothing on nobody!"
