SILAS HARMON
After old Uncle Silas had completed the task of raking up the leaves in my yard, I called him into the kitchen, seated him in a low chair, and gave him a cup of hot coffee. Characteristic of most old Negroes, coffee is one of Uncle Silas's chief weaknesses.
"Yes, ma'am, you can keep your meat of you'll jes' put de coffee to me."
As his rheumatic bones began to thaw, and the aroma of coffee filled the room, his conversation waxed eloquent. He has no teeth, but he likes his "pot likker and corn bread." "My eyes is poorly, too, an' I can't see so good. I reckon a body sees enough, though, of sech sights as is goin' on dese days. Times is sho' changed I can't git 'bout neither in cold weather, seem lak I have a misery in my legs, 'gin de frost come."
Uncle Silas is small and stooped, weighing hardly more than a hundred pounds. In spite of infirmities, there is a sprightliness of gait and spirit and a lustre in his small black chinquapin eyes. He has an unruly gray mustache and thick gray hair. On his head he wore a shabby old felt hat. His coat and trousers, which were much too large for him, hung loosely on his emaciated old frame.
"It don't look much lak Thanksgivin', sho' don't. Well, ef people come here an' think you got a heap, you can jes' s'prise 'em. I ain't got no better sense than to tell you de truf' 'bout everthing, for truf is my life.
"Now, when you got your hook in your hand, you ain't writ in' no foolishness, but you writin' de truf, for I ain't tellin' nothin' but - truf. I see your drif', you write 'bout me Well, we here to he'p one 'nother, I he'p you an' you he'p me.
"I was born in Dutch Fork, Lexington County, South Carolina. Bred an' born, sho'. I's one of three chillun. I had two sisters; one name Patsy, one name Rosa. My daddy name Will Harmon. His marster name Harley, over in de Dreher settlement. My ma name Rosa Moore, an' de Wises in Dutch Fork was her marster and missus.
"I's de only one left, though, all dead but me An' I was de first one born, too. I's eighty-five year old.
"Yes, ma'am, I been knowed through here a mighty long time. I tell you de truf, though; people here in Columbia don't know a sight 'bout me. I conducts myself quiet lak. Dey see me go 'long de street, and dey say, 'Dere go a old tramp.' Dey don't know it's Silas Harmon, a 'spectable nigger.
"My wife name Leila May Adams befo' I married her. She come from Georgia. We ain't got no chillun. She's poorly. My wife was sick seven or eight weeks in Savannah. Had tumor tuk out what weighed forty pounds.
"It's lak dis, I worked in Georgia in turpentine business for twenty- two year. Dat's where I made my wife's 'quaintance. I done a little ' cotton farmin', too. Turpentine job best job I ever had. Paid ever two weeks, twelve dollars. I made 'bout twenty-five dollars a month. When I sell de gum, I make eight dollars a barrel.
"I's healthy. Ain't never been sick in my life, 'cept three days flu in Georgia. I had ten bale of cotton in de field when I tuk sick, an' I got right out in dat cotton patch an' me an' my wife pick it all. Dey all say I was sho' to die, but ol' Silas still here.
"Me an' my wife was married in Georgia in her boss man's yard. Wan't married by no preacher, but de Trial Justice tied de knot.
"Her boss man say: 'I don't know you, but 'pears lak you good man. You well thought of round an' 'bout. Dis gal you marry today is good gal. You treat her right, or you have to 'count for it. Ef you jes' half do, she'll sho' do her part.'
"We was married on a Sunday evenin', an' we never had no great-to-do or nothin', but struck right out to my house in de cotton patch. I had right good house then, three rooms an' fireplace. Dat was befo' my circumstances was 'duced so low.
"We got right good house now; jes' two rooms, but it's a plenty for our needs. I pays a dollar and a half a week for rent. I never did have much good times. I worked all my days. I done a little bit of coon an' possum huntin', but never did b'lieve in all dis runnin' 'round. Dat didn't put nothin' in my pocket.
"My wife fifty-four year old, an' we been married thirty-eight year. I ain't never raise my hand to hit her in my life. I can't see no sense in people fightin', cussin', an' wranglin'. Ef dey gonna live dat away, dey ought to separate. An' ef dey meets one 'nother on de street or at a meetin', dey can jes' say good-evenin' an' 'pear 'spectful lak.
"I got me a sack of coal las' night. I tuk it home an' built up a good fire, an' me an' my wife set back an' didn't study 'bout nothin'; kinfolks, neighbors, or nothin'. You know I told my wife las' night, little as you know, we quietest family 'round here. Look lak dese others fights, gits drunk, cut up, an' even go out dere on de highway an' gives deyselves 'way. I ain't 'zactly onneighborly wid folks here 'bout, but jes' quiet an' shut-moufed. I totes myself in sech a way dey all puts a linen (lenient) hand towards me, 'cause I don't harm nobody.
"Ruther to have a han'ful of good friends than a bag full what ain't no good.
"I stayed in Georgia twenty-two year. Pa died while I was livin' in Georgia. Ma died after I come back. Pas use to say: 'Son, ef you needs anything, beg for it, don't never steal.' I say, ef God 'tend for me to have anything, I has it; ef he don't, then I does widout.
"I ain't never been in a lawsuit, trouble, or jail. I'll be hones', though, I come from Georgia to see my ma, 'cause she was feeble. An' dat man we worked for in Georgia, he come over here an' had us 'rested. You know how some people is, low-principle an' do anything. He had us 'rested by de high sheriff, an' de sheriff say: 'Tell me what is dese people done? Does you know dis is Silas Harmon, bred an' born here 'mongst us? I's a mind to have you locked up. An' de sooner you gits back to Georgia de healthier it will be for you.' But dis man was tough, an' wagged a bitter tongue. An' de sheriff say he reckon he have to 'bide by de law. An' bad as he hate to do it, dey lock us up. But us jes' stayed in jail 'til de sheriff do some tall 'vestigatin'; an' in 'bout four hours us was out.
"You see it was lak dis. He claim we s'pose to stay dere an' work for him, an' dat we come off unbeknowin's to him. I say: 'Course we aim to go back. Didn't we come off an' leave all our household b'longin's dere? I jes' step up here to see my ma.' Wan't long after dat, ma die. An' we never did go back to Georgia After ma die, we come to Columbia, an' ol' Silas been walkin' dese streets ever since, doin' odd jobs for plenty good white folks.
"I been workin' for Mis' Reid up here on Cypress Street many a year. Dey's sho' good folks. Ef I need little money, she give it to me. Yes, ma'am, I been knowed in through here 'bout thirty-odd year. Mis' Reid say: 'Ef you want somebody to do good work, git my nigger, old Silas, he treat you right.'
"Man ask me is I got an old age pension. I say, 'not so's I know it.' An' he say: 'Somebody ought to he'p you.' An' I say: 'Mis Reid he'p us.' Dey give her commodities for us. Mr. Reid sign de letter an' give my recom'dation. I's gonna tell you how de done. When dey sign us up, dey give one check on de house, combined us. I say I ain't got nothin', what's de use for me to cut-up? Ef Welfare didn't take care of me an' my wife, we'd be in de Po' House befo' water git hot.
"You see, it's lak dis. Mis' Reid got Welfare for my wife, 'cause my wife she's blind. De cataracts growed over her eyes, an' now she can't see nothin', but she can do a little work in de house. White people jes' crazy 'bout my wife. All de little chillun loves me an' my wife. It jes' kill my soul when she went blind.
"My wife is a Holiness preacher. She never start preachin' 'til after she went blind. Dis comin' Sunday, she aim to preach at Joan Tabernacle, not so fer from Assembly Street. She can sho' preach. Make your hair rise on your head to hear her preach. She preach one night dis week in de bed. She was 'wake, though, I thinks. Do you good to hear her. I can always tell when de spell comin' on her. She go to work an' sing an' pray. Then she give out de hymn an' tell you where her text is.
"What I'm talkin' 'bout, she ain't los' her mind. She got more sense than heap of 'em what makes a big noise an' say nothin'. What I'm talkin' 'bout, my wife's got de awfulest learnin'. She got good leamin'. My wife use to figure what we owe de storekeeper, an' what he owe us for cotton. He say he didn't want to never have no better settlement wid nobody than he always got wid us. She didn't never make no mistake. I went to school a little while, an' can read an' spell a little. But when you ain't got much, you soon lose what you got. An' now I done forgot how.
"Dere was a ol' man in Edgefield County, an' I mean I ain't tellin' you no lie; dat man couldn't read or write his own name. But I can't 'zactly call his name now. But what I means, when dat man lay down an' go to bed at night an' git to sleep, he'd preach de awfulest sermons you ever hear. Jes' lak he had plenty learnin'. He give out de number of de hymn. You look in de book, an' sho' 'nough dat was de right number. An' he give out his text an' tell you where to find it We look in de book, an' right dere where he say, we find it. Missus, I ain't tellin' you no lie, I's heard him. It was lak dis. We'd be settin' 'round visitin' lak, an' after while we say we reckon it's time to be gittin' on back Then we leaves an' goes down a good piece from his house an' stays 'til he git sleep an' start singin'. Then we sneaks back an' sneaks in his house, but dere wan't nothin' dat would wake him up when he start on dat mission. It was so strange lak, I'd git right nervous sometime. I figure it was jes' one of God's miracles. Dat ol' man he dead now, an' I bet his soul rest in heavenly peace.
"God, He got his eyes on all us poor folks. He know we have to go exposin' in de cold, wid mighty little rashions sometime, an' no shoes. Here I sets wid not a sock to my foot. But God say my foots is jes' as good as them what's got de cover on 'em.
"I hear talk of our President comin' here to Columbia soon. I sho' do crave to see him. Dey tell me he is de onliest President of dese United States dat ever try to he'p de poor folks. Well, he sho' must be a good man, for he got a sight of work to do. I ain't know much 'bout politics, ain't never vote. Reckon I was too young, but I sho' see de Red Shirts a ridin' up an' down de road when I live in Dutch Fork. Dat was when Hampton come in for governor. An' them Red Shirts sho' done a sight of ridin' an' wranglin' for Marse Hampton. Dey tell me a heap of young bucks did vote, but I didn't never git to cast mine.
"Well, Missus, I done chop you a heap of good wood, so I'll be gittin' on back to my wife. Late of a evenin' she jes' sets an' listens, and she say she can always tell when I'm 'most home. She know, too, dat I don't never go home widout I bring her a little favor. I tell her while I gone she ought to lay down an' res' her limbs, but she jes' walks 'round in de house an' tries to do 'bout a little.
"I cleaned a turkey for a lady yesterday, an' she give me some of it. I told her jes' spare me 'nough for my wife an' I'd sho' be thankful. Christmas, I go 'round 'mongst my white friends wid my basket, an' dey gives me fruit, turkey, cake an' everything, 'nough to las' me an' my wife three or four weeks. I sho' got good friends."
"Uncle Silas, before you go I wish you would bring a scuttle of coal and an armful of wood in the kitchen for me."
"Missus, I'll sho' be glad to. We here to he'p one 'nother."
As he came back into the kitchen, he pulled off his hat and held it in his hands, and in a Chesterfield manner bowed and said: "Missus, I's thankful we gittin' old, an' can change voice wid one 'nother, 'cause we don't know where death is." He slanted a look at the percolator.
"Ef you got any more coffee in dat pot, how 'bout jes' bile de grounds so's I can git het up a little befo' I starts. It's pretty cold today, an' my clothes is gittin' right airish."
He drank his coffee in silence, and got up to take his leave: "I'll be gittin' on now, for I knows my wife lookin' for me. She make out lak she don't worry 'bout me, but, bein' blind an' can't see, she gits lonely. One day, I git home 'round dark, an' she say to me, 'Silas, don't you never be uneasy 'bout your wife. You may come in an' find me speechless an' can't speak to you, but don't worry 'bout me, for you'll know I done gone on to rest. But I wants to know if you's comin' to meet me.'
"I goes up to her an' lays my hand on her head, an' says, 'Leila May, ef de good Lord spare me, an' nothin' happen, I'll sho' meet you on de shore of Jordan.' An' de Lord knows I's speakin' de truf. But it jes' kill my soul when she went blind."
