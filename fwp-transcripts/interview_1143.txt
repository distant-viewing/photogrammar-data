"We Greeks in America observe some of the holidays and customs of the old country, in a way. Our principal celebrations are Eastar and Christmas. Easter is our big celebration. In the old country the celebration begins with services in the Cathedral at 4 o'clock in the morning, sunrise. After that everybody makes fun; there are a lot of fireworks; everybody keeps open house; every Greek home is open on that day to everybodywho wants to walk in. We feast much; almost every home has its roast or bar-becued lamb, with salads, cheese, hard boiled eggs and native wine.
"I have tried to barbecue lamb as they do in the old country; but I make a mess of it. They rub a dressed kid or a lamb with garlic; put pepper and salt on it, first coating it with olive oil to make the pepper and salt stick. The lamb is then put on a spit several feet away from the fire and turned from time to time until done so tender the meat falls from the bones when removed from the spit to its pan. And all the time it is basted frequently with a sauce made of olive oil and lemon juice whipped together like mayonnaise and flavored with leaves of thyme. My wife tasted a kid barbecued that way when she visited the old country with me in 1937. She says it was the best meat she ever tasted. My wife, an American girl, didn't like garlic much when we were first married, but after that trip to the old country and eating food over there she's crazy about it.
