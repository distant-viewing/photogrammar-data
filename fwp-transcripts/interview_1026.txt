JACKSONVILLE - "Villa Alexandria"
Mrs. Phena Hudnall Love,
216 West Miami Road,
South Jacksonville, Florida.
"Mrs. Alexander Mitchell, (Martha Reed) was the sister of Harrison Reed, Post-War governor of Florida by appointment of a Republic U.S. President, and the widow of Alexander Mitchell, of Milwaukee, <text not clear> millionaire president of the Illinois Central Railway, and rated as one of the wealthiest men of the West.
"Mrs. Mitchell was a very beautiful woman, charitable in the <text not clear> of fine character, and not at all in accord with her brother, <text not clear> who was later impeached and removed from office. She re<text not clear> have anything to do with him and never mentioned his name. Ex-Gov Harrison Reed, died in a little old house at the foot of Flagler- Street in South Jacksonville).
"After the death of Mr. Mitchell, his widow came to Florida, went to California - she always traveled, in a private car and had a <text not clear>of people with her as guests. She lived in Santa Barbara and Los <text not clear> for a year and a half, trying to decide whether she wished to establish her home there or in Florida. At the end of that period she came to Jacksonville, stopping at the St. James Hotel, then (in the early 70's) <text not clear>ding hostelry, and arranged for the purchase of 125 acres of land on the banks of the St. Johns River on the South Side now near at St. Nicholas place which she called "Villa Alexandria."
"She had plans drawn in Milwaukee for a beautiful home here, and brought down architects, artisans, materials, and erected the mansion on the water's edge.
"Everything was on a very magnificent scale, and it was later <text not clear> with the most expensive and beautiful furnishings, period furniture from foreign lands, statuary, etc.
"The library was said to have been the finest south of Washington D.C., with original paintings on the walls by old masters, etchings, <text not clear> hundreds of old volumes, handsomely and expensively bound.
"The linen-room on the second floor was spacious and well <text not clear> equipped with open racks so that the air could pass through easily, <text not clear> large room adjoining for the use of the house-keeper.
"After Mrs. Mitchell's death, it fell to my lot to inventory her <text not clear> and the linen-room was especially interesting. There were dozens sets of matched linens for table use, all elaborately embroidered, <text not clear>with intricate drawn-work, all having her monogram and initials in embroidery, She kepts, two French women busy in Paris, who did <text not clear> but embroider her household end table linens, and paid them by the year for this work. Royalty never had anything to surpass her possessions in this respect. There were many sets that had never even been unwrapped.
"The draperies were all imported. The bed-rooms were all done <text not clear>inty colors, each equipped with a private bath. Mrs. Mitchell's bed-room was a duplicate of one of the early French Queens - in white <text not clear> The ceiling was white maple also, panelled with strips of old rose <text not clear>, the canopy and bed drapiers of the some imported material. One nature was a wide bay window overlooking the St. Johns River, which is particularly expansive and beautiful at this point, with curved seats built in, upholstered in the same material, and many lovely cushions. The rugs were all of the oriently imported variety.
"Her commodious dressing room led off from the bed-room, with a sufficient marble bathroom. There was also adjoining, a room floored and paneled with cedar, with closets and drawers, and ample boxes in which were our beautiful dresses and accessories. Mrs. Mitchell had been ill <text not clear> period before her death, and I found many dresses made by her <text not clear>French dress-maker on previous order, still in their original <text not clear> and had never been worn.
"The dining-room was octagon shaped, and the mahogany finishing <text not clear> paneled ceiling, the windows, doors, cabinets/etc, were installed at an estimated <text not clear> $50,000. The cabinets were filled with the finest of imported <text not clear>that money could buy. This large dining-room seated thirty. Fine <text not clear> graced the walls, and between the pictures we re silver lighting <text not clear>The floors throughout were of the finest hard-wood variety.
"Alexander and Mrs. Mitchell's only son was John Mitchell, who became a united states senator from winconsin. He had one son, David Mitchell, who made his home at Villa Alexandria, and married Kitty parrott, daughter of an official of the Florida East coast Railway.
"when Kitty Mitchell cams to make her home there, her suite was over all in pure white, with white furniture and all other furnishings.
"The master-bedroom occupied by David was twenty-four feet square, with great mirrors in the dressing room and accommodations for his hundreds suits of clothes. The private bath-room, attached had tiffany glass winters a bath-tub carved out of a solid block of/imported Pyrrean marble, the fittings mounted with ivory and silver. The large washstand also was of the same beautiful marble. There was a square bathing pool, with arrangements made for <text not clear>kish, needle, or shower baths, as desired, reading from this bath-room a medicine closet, completely stocked, a small drug-store in itself.
"The collections of books in the library were beyond description, us were the cabinets that held the beautiful pictures. One box which held pictures portrayed from Holy Script done on parchment - each_
<text not clear> one of the old masters - was priceless. The cabinets were everything strewn around, but I gathered up these belongings <text not clear>tly, dusted than off, and packed them properly numbered and tagged <text not clear>sofa cushions to try to protect them from the dust am improper.
"Kitty Mitchell is father, Mr. Parrott, sold the house to Harry Mason who strapped it of the beautiful furnishings and equipment and <text not clear> them away.
<text not clear>FUL GROUNDS:
"Mrs. Mitchell also brought landscape gardeners, who terraced grounds and made them a beautiful sight to behold.

She gave thousands of dollars to this institution. At the end of the fiscal year, whatever amount was lacking to cover the operating expenses of the instution, she sent her check to cover. In addition, she supported a lot of people in Jacksonville and Duval County before the days of organized charity, and was a good example of the old adage, "Truly, her left hand knoweth not <text not clear>her right hand doeth."
"Mrs. Mitchell possessed most magnificent jewelry. One set <text not clear> in particular was of black pearls - ear-rings, necklace and - said to have belonged, to one of the Queens of Europe.
