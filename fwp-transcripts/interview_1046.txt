Miami, Florida
Master Nicholas Papa Petron, age 40, is a hale appearing man with a ruddy complexion, dark hair and very bright dark open. His neat grooming and his happy, anger, confident expression distinguish him as a person of unusual intelligence and refinement.
Master Papa Petron conducts a church school for the Greek children from four to six <text not clear> afternoon during the regular school year. The school is supported by the church, and although no distinct religious training is given, many moral lessons are taught in the reading classes through the simple stories in the text books. The aim of the school is to teach the pupils to read and write the Greek language as mental discipline, to <text not clear> it <text not clear> for them to learn other for<text not clear> language as in high school, to aid them to secure positions where interpreters are needed, and to keep the children interested in the Greek church through their ability to understand the services.
The text books are a ranged like American school readers with short stories and bright pictures of American children, games, and pots. The stories teach good health habits, such as <text not clear>thing, brushing the tooth, taking proper sleep and exercise, also kindness to animals and playmates, abandoned to parents and habits of truthfulness.
Mr. Petron explained: "I very <text not clear> use my titles when signing my <text not clear>, except on my passports. <text not clear> the title of Factor when I graduated from Normal school in Cyprus. My title, Papa was my birthday <text not clear> by the Greek Orthodox <text not clear> because I am the son of <text not clear>riest. My father having <text not clear> ried before taking the <text not clear> of priesthood at <text not clear>, Cyprus. This <text not clear>, which <text not clear> orally observed by my church, is the all of point of difference between the Greek Orthodox and the <text not clear> Catholic <text not clear>.
"Except in the schoolroom where I am called Taster." I am usually called 'Papa Petron' and I usually, <text not clear> my name, <text not clear> P. Petron."
"My father was a teacher and I had all the advantages of getting a good education. I finished school at an early age and then was seat to boarding school. My masters were appointed by the English Government. The English language was never difficult for me. I love it, only I find that I haven't a fluent tongue to speak it. I've studied for 15 years, but I still need a special teacher to help no express myself better. Our school was a very high-class school. We had to high a paper that we didn't dance, didn't drink a smoke and didn't do any of those things. Couldn't have stayed there, if we didn't leave (live) clean lives. If I didn't, the children would read it on me.
"After I applied to the consul for <text not clear> to come to America. I had to wait three cars <text not clear> I was notified. My consul bought my ticket and told me just what to do. <text not clear> no trouble <text not clear> ever <text not clear> position as teacher had hour, secured by the ch<text not clear> in Roanoke. Virginia. I was paid for my teaching and loading the choice.
"I thought I have the English language very well, bat I had <text not clear>, of trouble getting read to the American language, for I had only British English teacher. One of the first things I discovered was that Americans do not talk like my teachers talked, so I was afraid to use my English at first. I always carried with me <text not clear> dictionary in my pocket and I made good use of it. My annual did not tell me how to get to R<text not clear> from now <text not clear>. I hated to ask anyone for fear they would think me very ignorant.
"I went to the station with my language, but what to do, I did not know. I stood there and <text not clear> and there I saw some letters staring at <text not clear> I <text not clear> to myself that word is in-for-ma-tion! What that word information could means I couldn't <text not clear> off it. I use fallen go to that <text not clear> I looked in my dictionary and <text not clear> was like a friend to help me. They told me where to buy my ticket and I thought I had all the information I needed.
"I brought my ticket and understand the <text not clear> to tell me that the train would come at 10 <text not clear> o'clock (10:30). I tl<text not clear> that was what <text not clear> what 10 o'clock <text not clear>, but I couldn't thing what 10<text not clear> could noun. I couldn't find it in my dictionary.
"Ha! Ha! It is funny now when I think of it! Wall, I just sat there. I <text not clear> I'd ask <text not clear> trading came in, if it would take me to <text not clear> o'clock came but no train and oh, it seemed an long to wait until 10 hearty! <text not clear>
"I had the correct address of where I was <text not clear> in Roano<text not clear>, but I had no idea how I was going to find it.
I had read about the English Bobbies, so I thought I'd know a poli<text not clear>, I'll saw one. Sure enough! I stopped up to a man in uniform and told him <text not clear> I <text not clear> to go.
<text not clear> don't <text not clear> take a taxing to asked.

"<text not clear>, I <text not clear> to find a resti<text not clear> have me a <text not clear> card, I should see that it was printed in English bat I was afraid to try to say the words in a office, and besides there were so many words that I didn't know what they meant and I didn't want to take out my dictionary there before the waiter. So I just gave a quick <text not clear> at the noun and said:
"Human'<text not clear>!" (ham and eggs), "I didn't know what that was, but I renumbered of hearing a <text not clear> and in How York that he went to a restaurant and made a <text not clear> of <text not clear> So I thought if he could out it <text not clear> it was. I could eat it once anyway.

"Before you come to America you studied English, French and Latin. You graduated from boarding school in Creek and no you have a hard time learning American. It is so different from British English. Well, anyway I didn't <text not clear> a big break that time.
"Another time, I wanted a glass of milk. An I had been taught that it is more polite to speak in sentences, I asked:
"Hav 'you <text not clear>' The waitress couldn't <text not clear>rutand me. I repeated ever and ever as planning as I could: 'Hav' you <text not clear>:' Finally she asked: 'What do you want?' O said: 'Moolk' She Laughed:

They opened the book of <text not clear>, pointed to four lines and said: 'See if you <text not clear> slate these Four lines.' <text not clear>'I can't do that, but I'll login at the first <text not clear> translate the whole book for you.
